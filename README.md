### ST-DISTAL : Learning Spatial Transcriptomics Deconvolution via Spectral-Spatial Dual-Branch GCNs with Distributional Alignment

This repository contains the implementation of **ST-DISTAL**, a framework for accurate and biologically meaningful cell-type deconvolution in spatial transcriptomics data.

## Repository Structure

`./STDISTAL/GCN.py`
Implementation of the dual-branch GCN and the training logic. Code sections are annotated with corresponding equation numbers from the paper for clarity.

`./data/`
Contains a representative subset of the seqFISH+ dataset used for demonstration and testing.

`./output/`
Output directory for predictions and results.
